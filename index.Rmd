title: "My Website"

Welcome! This is my website created with R Markdown in RStudio. It's connected with my github account so I can quickly commit and push updates out. It's still a work in progress but it can quickly be built up.   

One interesting thing that I can do is run R code directly to produce interesting output (with the knitr package I have access to approximately 30 other programming languages too). For example, consider the plot below from the gapminder dataset (a classic!). It displays the change of GDP per capita and life expectancy over time. This dataset is perfect for the dplyr package (practice with the pipe operator) along with ggplot2, ggplotly, and plotly for cool visuals. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
data(gapminder, package = "gapminder")
gg <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, frame = year, ids = country)) +
  scale_x_log10()
ggplotly(gg)
```

There is so much to do!
